Kamalan Web Framework
=======

An easy-use web framework for front-end developer and JavaScript people. Kamalan is NOT a traditional MVC web framework. It aims to provide a new way to develop web service without server-side knowledge.

With integration of front-end/back-end web development experiences, it uses JavaScript class method instead of tranditional communication methods. There is no need to understand GET/POST methods of HTTP protocol and handle Ajax stuffs, developer totally can write a web service with front-end web development experence only.

Kamalan is based on Express web framework in Node.js, it means developer do not need to learn a new thing and can use all express middleware. If you do not want to use special feature of Kamalan, you can still do your job under old school MVC model.
